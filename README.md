# Lab 8 - Starter

Chun Hang Chan

1. I would fit my automated tests in my Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. It is because I can check if the code works correctly after the tests run for all the pushes. 
2. No, it is because an end to end test is used for emulating user actions from start to finish.
3. No, it is because many components will interact with each other if testing the "message" feature of a messaging application. While unit tests only test individual parts in the code.
4. Yes, it is because there will be no interaection with other components for testing the "max message length" feature of a messaging application as only the input is needed.
